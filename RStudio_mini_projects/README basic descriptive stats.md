PROJECT TITLE: 
Descriptive Statistics and Multiple Regression  

PROJECT OVERVIEW:  
The task involves exploring a dataset from the Wooldridge package, formulating a research question, and performing a series of statistical analyses. Specifically, I investigate how various independent variables impact standardized reading and math scores.

The dataset used for this problem set is the catholic dataset from the Wooldridge package. This dataset provides cross-sectional individual data on schooling, which includes information on student demographics, parental education, and academic performance.

Research Question:
The research question for this analysis is:

Which independent variables most significantly impact the dependent variables (standardized reading and math scores)?

Variables:
Dependent Variables: Standardized scores for reading (read12) and math (math12).
Independent Variables: Gender (female), ethnicity (categorical variables: asian, hispan, black), parents' years of education (motheduc, fatheduc), log of family income (lfaminc), high school graduation status by 1994 (hsgrad), attendance at a Catholic high school (cathhs), and whether the parent is Catholic (parcath).
Control Variable: Person identifier (id).
This question is chosen because it explores the multiple factors that might influence academic performance and aims to identify the most impactful variables.

NOTE:
Ensure that the Wooldridge package is installed and loaded correctly in your R environment to access the catholic dataset.
